# Task App (React.js)

`You are on the classic-redux branch. 
Here the counter logic has been built using a classic Redux approach`

> It's a very simple counter app that can:

- increment the number by 1;
- decrement the nuber by 1;
- increase the number by 5;
- open and close the counter (the counter number will be returned back to 0 on close)

`NOTE: The app was created using 2 different approaches:

- the first uses the classic Redux approach;
- the second approach uses the Redux toolkit (switch to the 'redux-toolkit' branch to view the code).`

## The goals of creating this application:

The main goals for me as a web developer were to improve my skills in working with:

- the classic Redux:
  - the createStore() Redux method;
  - creating the counter reducer functions;
  - the useDispatch() react-redux hook;
  - the useSelector() react-redux hook;
- JavaScript switch/case statement

## To start the app on your machine:

1. Clone the project to your machine by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/SharinLana/react-redux-counter.git
```

2. To install the project dependencies, run:

```
npm install
```

3. When the installation is complete, run the following command to start the app:

```
npm start
```

4. To view the code of the alternative approach:

```
git switch redux-toolkit
```

## Languages, frameworks, libraries, packages, tools and technologies:

- React.js
- Redux (redux and react-redux packages)
- JavaScript
- CSS

## Functionalities:

- incrementing, decrementing the number of the counter;
- displaying components conditionally;
- responsive design (mobile adaptation);
